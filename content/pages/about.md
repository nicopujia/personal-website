### Early exploration

I started at the age of 12 by developing projects on my own with [**Python**]({tag}python), including web scraping tools, video games, automation scripts, mobile and desktop applications, and [more](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). I also learned [**Godot**]({tag}godot) as I wanted to create _mobile_ games.

At the end of 2022 and during 2023, I learned [**Dart** & **Flutter**]({tag}flutter) to create _high-performance_ multi-platform software. At the same time, I started using **Git** & **GitHub** to keep better track of my projects. I published those first apps and video games to the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8059097220194731179), including [Game Finder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nicopujia.gamefinder).

In late 2023 and the beginning of 2024, I experimented with **computer networking** to create an online multi-platform, multiplayer game called [Biome Fighters]({filename}/biome-fighters.md), which led me to participate in [BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters).

### From hobbyist to professional

#### Siderplast

After that, thanks to a [friend](https://franciscoaurelio.com) of mine, I got my first paid and really large [project]({filename}/siderplast.md) for a client. Although I had experience with [**FastAPI**]({tag}fastapi), I chose to specialize in [**Django**]({tag}django) while developing this one, as it was a better fit for its requirements. I also learned **Docker**, **MySQL**, and **Nginx** in the process, as well as non-technical skills like **handling large projects** and **dealing with clients**. I constantly refined the scalability of the code to ensure the project remained sustainable.

#### Silver.dev

2025 arrived and I could finally meet someone who I had been listening to his [podcast](https://silver.dev/podcast) for about two years. I'm talking about [Gabriel Benmergui](https://x.com/conanbatt), founder of [Silver.dev](https://silver.dev) and staff engineer with over 15 years of experience in the industry. I had applied to the Founder Engineer position, and I was called for the live coding, but Gabriel wasn't going to hire me for that because I had little experience. However, given my performance —_I broke the record of the fastest developer to complete the challenge, even beating people with 10+ years of experience_—, he invented a position for me as an intern.

Here, I've learned a lot about [**TypeScript** & **NextJS**]({tag}nextjs) and, most importantly, about **product engineering** and **user experience**.

In the middle of that, I participated in the [ShipBA](https://shipba.dev) hackathon, where I created [Noticiar]({filename}/noticiar.md), meeting a lot of amazing people.
