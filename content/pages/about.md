## Journey

### Early exploration

I started at the age of 12 by developing projects on my own with **Python**, including web scraping tools, video games, automation scripts, mobile and desktop applications, and [more](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). I also learned **Godot** as I wanted to create *mobile* [games](/projects/technologies/godot.html).

### More personal projects

At the end of 2022 and during 2023, I learned **Dart** & **Flutter** to create *high-performance* multi-platform [software](/projects/technologies/flutter.html). At the same time, I started using **Git** & **GitHub** to keep better track of my projects. I successfully published those first apps and video games to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8059097220194731179).

In late 2023 and the beginning of 2024, I experimented with **computer networking** to create an online multi-platform, multiplayer [video game]({filename}/biome-fighters.md). I developed the prototype, set it aside, and a few months later, I was called to [participate in BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters) because they had found my project interesting. Although I did not end up at the top, I quickly learned how to deal with **deadlines**.

### From hobbyist to professional

After that, thanks to a [friend](https://franciscoaurelio.com) of mine, I got my first paid and really large [project]({filename}/siderplast.md) for a client. Although I had experience with **FastAPI** from my previous project, I chose to specialize in **Django** while developing this one, as it was a better fit for its requirements. I also learned **Docker**, **MySQL**, and **Nginx** in the process, as well as non-technical skills like **handling large projects** and **dealing with clients**. I constantly refined the scalability of the code to ensure the project remained sustainable.

## Beyond programming

I have always enjoyed playing football ⚽️ and other kinds of physical activity. Although I was not naturally talented, it taught me **persistence**—never giving up even when things get tough. Moreover, **teamwork** is an essential skill when playing this sport, and that’s another skill I have learned and even been awarded for.
