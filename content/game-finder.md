### Process

The idea came from a problem I had back then. I used to play video games, but it was hard for me to find new ones to play, especially on the platforms I had available, such as the PS3 and retro emulators. Existing solutions didn't offer the filters I needed to find something I enjoyed.

So, I learned new things as needed, solved my problem, and finally published it to the Google Play Store. Without any marketing effort, it obtained a 45% conversion rate and 800+ downloads worldwide, currently with 100+ new users per month.
