Casual mobile video game I created with the instruction that [a friend of mine](https://youtube.com/@C_25Music) gave me to create a _satisfying game_. It's quite simple: an endless game with a spaceship that has to destroy asteroids and avoid its destruction.

### Credits

Some sprites (the spaceship and the power-ups, to be specific) where made by my friend Agustin Capelari, and the rest where taken from the internet (except the buttons).
