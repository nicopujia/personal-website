The second video game I have ever made and my first platformer. It includes very annoying game mechanics in 5 different levels with not-the-best sprites.

Curious fact: the level objects are placed manually with their coordinates. _Yeah, not the most efficient way._

Despite its negative aspects, it's still a challenging game to play.
