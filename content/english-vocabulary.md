Mobile app made for Spanish speaking users learning English to help them save the words they don't know, so the can practice the vocabulary and easily access the translation, image and audio of each word.

### Deprecated

Originally, the app used to work perfectly and you could download it from the Google Play Store. One day, unfortunately, the website from where the app scraped the images (<https://canstockphoto.com>) stopped working due to the raise of AI image generation.

Here's what the website had to say:

> October 1, 2023
>
> Can Stock Photo has now ceased operations.
>
> After nearly 20 years in business we have been forced to make this very difficult decision and would like to thank our many thousands of talented contributors and customers for making it possible. The industry has changed significantly over this time, with CanStock launched in 2004 during the early mass adoption of digital cameras, and before "social media" was even a phrase. Today of course everyone has a capable digital camera in their pocket, and the advent of AI means amazing images can be created from programs with just a few keywords. Decreased business and increasing costs has made it no longer possible to keep operating, to our great disappointment.

> [...]
>
> Thank you for everything,
>
> \- The Can Stock Photo Team

Although I could, of course, find another source for the app's images, I simply prefer to focus on my latest, more exciting projects.
