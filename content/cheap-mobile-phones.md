A (deprecated) web scraper (with a GUI included) to find cheap mobile phones in [Mercado Libre](https://mercadolibre.com.ar).

The interesting thing is that it didn't just use the filters provided by the web store, it also went into each publication and analized the description and features of each mobile phone.

For example, if I wanted to search for second hand phones in Mercado Libre, the problem was that many of then said that were broken, but only in the description. So, with this scraper, that extra step of manually filtering broken phones was removed by this automation script.
