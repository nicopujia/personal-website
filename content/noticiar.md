*AI-powered* TikTok-like web app of unbiased daily **news** on what matters to *you* in just *two* minutes. Made for [ShipBA](https://shipba.dev) hackathon in 24 hours â€” without sleeping.

It scrapes news articles from multiple sources and, based on what they talk about, merges them into single events using Gemini. Thanks to this, the app provides information as unbiased as possible.

The app is meant to save you as much time as possible, but still keep you informed about what you care about. That's why when scrolling, you first only see the heading. If you want to inquire more, you tap and get 3 bullet points. And if want to inquire even more, then you can go to each source of information. Once you've finished, which usually won't take more than 2 minutes, you are up to date.
