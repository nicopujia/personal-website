1v1 **online multiplayer** [platform fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_fighter) video game prototype with a retro aesthetic, where there are more than just two platforms and _every corner is an opportunity for the victory_. It is inspired in [Spelunky's deatchmath](<https://spelunky.fandom.com/wiki/Deathmatch_(HD)>), but taken to a competitive online multiplayer environment.

### Prototype

Please note that the current version is only prototype, so a lot of [initial ideas for the game](https://github.com/nicopujia/biome_fighters/labels/Enhancement) are not implemented. It only includes a minimal playable experience in a map with some platforms, with one biome (the desert) and one character (the cactus).

### [BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters)

I developed the prototype in the summer (January in Argentina) of 2023/24, making it public in GitHub. In February, I was sent an email to participate in this program.

> hey Nicol√°s, I found your repo biome_fighters while searching for new projects building with godot [...]. I'm part of an online program for builders called Backdrop Build, and I think that program would be a great fit given what you are building.

Unfortunately, during the program I was hardly able to develop anything new. I spent a lot of time refactoring because in the state the code was in, it was impossible to add new content without creating unintelligible spaghetti.
