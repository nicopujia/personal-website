Collection of open source tools I worked on during my internship at [Silver.dev](https://silver.dev).

The repo contains:

- [**Fees Calculator**](https://open.silver.dev/fees-calculator): helps Silver align on contract terms quickly and clearly with its clients.
- [**Behavioral Checker**](https://open.silver.dev/behavioral-checker): answer interivew questions speaking in English and get AI feedback following Silver's recommendations.
- [**Resume Checker**](https://open.silver.dev/resume-checker): same as behavioral checker but for resumes.

I created the fees calculator and polished the Behavioral and Resume checkers. I also integrated those candidate tools with the [interview prepping]({filename}/interview-prepping.md) section of the Silver app.
