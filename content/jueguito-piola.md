Mobile platformer video game prototype where you have to beat the levels as fast as possible, not only to set the best time but also because there is a light ray behind you. If you stay still, you get electrocuted! In order to go faster, the character can dash.

### Screenshots

There are like two versions: the initial one and the "RTX" one, where I added special effects such as lights and new sprites, but in this one there is only one level.

### Name

I didn't know how to name it so that's why chose "Jueguito Piola", which in Spanish means something like "**good little game**".

### Remake

This game is the remake of one of my previous games, [Time Runs]({filename}/time-runs.md). Nowadays, I think Time Runs is better — it's funnier to play. But I think the first version of Jueguito Piola is the best platformer I've ever made (see above in the screenshots section to know what I'm talking about). It's not available anymore because I updated the game and at the time I didn't use Git or any other version control system. The last remake of this game is [The Last Shock]({filename}/the-last-shock.md) (_don't ask me why I made 3 versions of the same platformer game_).

### Anecdote

I remember sharing it with my classmates. At its time, we were all playing and competing to see who beated the (only three) levels faster. And I, the developer, wasn't even the best at it. Pretty funny moments.

### Credits

And talking about classmates, [one of them](https://www.youtube.com/@C_25Music) made the music and the other (Agustín Capelari) made some of the graphics.
